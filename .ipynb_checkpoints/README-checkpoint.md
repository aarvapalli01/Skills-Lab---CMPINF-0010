## How It Works
Our program works by prompting the user to enter in their name and age. It will then return a sentence incorporating the user input information. The sentence will follow the following structure: "Your name is ___ and your age is ___ ."

## How To Use It
The program can be run using a python compiler. Make sure to have the latest python version downloaded. Download the newfile.py to your system and run the file on any compiler. Following compilation, the program will ask for the inputs and return the previously mentioned sentence altered by the given information. 

## How To Contribute To It
Please feel free to contribute to the program by adding any desired features. This can be done by forking the repository and then make a pull request with the added prompts for which you feel are necessary. Any proposed contributions would be greatly appreciated!

## Why We Chose Our Code of Conduct
We decided to use the Contributor Covenant for out code of conduct because we feel it gives a thorough explanation of how people should be treated and interact in a collaborative environment. It also makes it clear that if these rules are not followed, people can be punished and not allowed to interact with the project anymore.
